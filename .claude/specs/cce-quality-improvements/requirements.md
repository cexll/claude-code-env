# CCE Quality Improvements - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical quality improvements for the Claude Code Environment Switcher (CCE) based on validation feedback that scored 88/100. The focus is on eliminating code duplication, improving interface consistency, enhancing model validation, and addressing architectural concerns to achieve a 95%+ quality score while maintaining the strong foundation already implemented.

## Requirements

### 1. Code Quality Enhancement
**User Story**: As a developer maintaining CCE, I want to eliminate code duplication and improve interface consistency so that the codebase is more maintainable and follows best practices.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** environment variable injection is needed **THEN** a shared `EnvironmentVariableBuilder` pattern SHALL be used across all launcher implementations
2. **WHEN** the `PassthroughLauncher` is implemented **THEN** it SHALL properly implement the `ClaudeCodeLauncher` interface with all required methods
3. **WHEN** functions require multiple parameters **THEN** they SHALL use structured parameter objects to reduce complexity
4. **WHEN** code is duplicated between launchers **THEN** it SHALL be extracted into shared utilities or patterns
5. **WHEN** interfaces are defined **THEN** all implementations SHALL fully comply with the interface contract

### 2. Enhanced Model Validation
**User Story**: As a user configuring model settings, I want comprehensive model validation that goes beyond pattern matching so that I can be confident my model configuration will work with the target API.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** a model is configured **THEN** the system SHALL validate the model name against known patterns
2. **WHEN** network connectivity is available **THEN** the system SHALL optionally perform API connectivity validation for model verification
3. **WHEN** model validation fails **THEN** the system SHALL provide specific suggestions for valid model names
4. **WHEN** an environment is validated **THEN** model compatibility with the API endpoint SHALL be checked if validation is enabled
5. **WHEN** model validation is performed **THEN** results SHALL be cached to avoid repeated API calls

### 3. Interface Unification and Architecture
**User Story**: As a developer working with CCE, I want unified interfaces and consistent architecture patterns so that the system is easier to understand, test, and extend.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** launcher interfaces are defined **THEN** all launcher implementations SHALL implement the same base interface
2. **WHEN** delegation plans are created **THEN** they SHALL use a unified interface pattern across all components
3. **WHEN** environment variable injection is needed **THEN** a single, tested pattern SHALL be used
4. **WHEN** error handling is implemented **THEN** consistent error types and recovery patterns SHALL be used
5. **WHEN** the architecture is evaluated **THEN** it SHALL demonstrate clear separation of concerns and dependency injection

### 4. Advanced Flag Conflict Resolution
**User Story**: As a user running complex Claude commands through CCE, I want sophisticated flag conflict resolution so that CCE and Claude CLI flags can coexist without issues.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** CCE and Claude CLI flags conflict **THEN** the system SHALL apply intelligent resolution strategies
2. **WHEN** flag conflicts are detected **THEN** the system SHALL provide clear warnings and resolution options
3. **WHEN** ambiguous flag combinations exist **THEN** the system SHALL prompt for user clarification when appropriate
4. **WHEN** flag resolution occurs **THEN** the decision logic SHALL be transparent and logged
5. **WHEN** flag parsing fails **THEN** the system SHALL provide actionable error messages with suggestions

### 5. Performance Monitoring and Optimization
**User Story**: As a system administrator using CCE, I want detailed performance monitoring so that I can understand the overhead of delegation and optimize workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** delegation occurs **THEN** the system SHALL track timing metrics for each phase
2. **WHEN** performance data is collected **THEN** it SHALL include delegation strategy selection time, environment injection time, and process launch time
3. **WHEN** performance issues are detected **THEN** the system SHALL provide diagnostic information
4. **WHEN** caching is used **THEN** cache hit/miss ratios SHALL be tracked and reported
5. **WHEN** performance monitoring is enabled **THEN** it SHALL have minimal impact on actual execution time

### 6. Error Recovery and Robustness
**User Story**: As a user experiencing issues with CCE, I want automated error recovery capabilities so that temporary problems don't require manual intervention.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** configuration migration fails **THEN** the system SHALL automatically attempt rollback to the previous working state
2. **WHEN** network validation fails **THEN** the system SHALL provide fallback options and retry logic
3. **WHEN** environment validation fails **THEN** the system SHALL suggest specific remediation steps
4. **WHEN** process launch fails **THEN** the system SHALL attempt alternative launch strategies if available
5. **WHEN** critical errors occur **THEN** the system SHALL preserve user data and provide recovery guidance

### 7. Consolidated Parameter Patterns
**User Story**: As a developer maintaining CCE functions, I want consolidated parameter patterns so that functions are easier to understand, test, and modify.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** functions have more than 4 parameters **THEN** they SHALL use structured parameter objects or builder patterns
2. **WHEN** parameter objects are used **THEN** they SHALL include validation methods
3. **WHEN** optional parameters are needed **THEN** they SHALL use builder patterns or option structs
4. **WHEN** function signatures change **THEN** parameter objects SHALL provide backward compatibility where possible
5. **WHEN** testing functions **THEN** parameter objects SHALL simplify test data setup

### 8. Enhanced Testing and Validation
**User Story**: As a developer ensuring CCE quality, I want comprehensive testing coverage for all improvements so that the enhanced functionality is reliable and maintainable.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** new patterns are implemented **THEN** they SHALL have unit tests with at least 90% coverage
2. **WHEN** interfaces are unified **THEN** integration tests SHALL verify compatibility
3. **WHEN** error recovery is implemented **THEN** failure scenarios SHALL be tested
4. **WHEN** performance monitoring is added **THEN** benchmarks SHALL validate overhead claims
5. **WHEN** model validation is enhanced **THEN** both successful and failure cases SHALL be tested

### 9. Documentation and Migration
**User Story**: As a user upgrading to the improved CCE, I want clear documentation and smooth migration so that I can take advantage of new features without disruption.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** new features are implemented **THEN** they SHALL be documented with examples
2. **WHEN** breaking changes are made **THEN** migration guides SHALL be provided
3. **WHEN** configuration changes are needed **THEN** automatic migration SHALL be attempted
4. **WHEN** performance characteristics change **THEN** they SHALL be documented
5. **WHEN** troubleshooting is needed **THEN** diagnostic commands and guides SHALL be available

### 10. Security and Compliance
**User Story**: As a security-conscious user, I want assurance that quality improvements maintain the existing security standards so that sensitive data remains protected.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** new patterns are implemented **THEN** they SHALL maintain existing security practices for API key handling
2. **WHEN** error messages are enhanced **THEN** they SHALL not expose sensitive information
3. **WHEN** logging is improved **THEN** sensitive data SHALL continue to be masked
4. **WHEN** caching is implemented **THEN** cached data SHALL not include sensitive information
5. **WHEN** network validation is enhanced **THEN** SSL/TLS validation SHALL be maintained
