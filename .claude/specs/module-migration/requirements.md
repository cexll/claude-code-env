# Module Path Migration Requirements

## Introduction
This specification defines the requirements for updating the Go module path from the current `github.com/claude-code/env-switcher` to the new canonical path `github.com/cexll/claude-code-env`. This migration must ensure seamless continuity of development workflows, maintain compatibility with existing systems, and provide clear rollback mechanisms.

## Requirements

### 1. Module Path Update
**As a** Go developer/project maintainer  
**I want** to seamlessly migrate my module path from `github.com/claude-code/env-switcher` to `github.com/cexll/claude-code-env`
**So that** the repository maintains its canonical identity across all package consumers

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1.1 The module path declared in `go.mod` MUST be updated to `github.com/cexll/claude-code-env`
1.2 The module name change MUST be atomic and validated through compilation
1.3 The change MUST reflect across ALL import statements in the codebase
1.4 The change MUST maintain semantic versioning starting from v1.1.0

### 2. Import Path Refactoring
**As a** codebase maintainer  
**I want** all internal package import paths to be updated consistently
**So that** there are no compilation errors or runtime issues

#### Acceptance Criteria:
2.1 ALL Go source files MUST have imports updated from `github.com/claude-code/env-switcher/` to `github.com/cexll/claude-code-env/`
2.2 The refactoring MUST use consistent automated tools (gofmt, goimports)
2.3 The change MUST preserve line-by-line attribution for git blame analysis
2.4 The change MUST NOT introduce any functional modifications beyond path updates

### 3. Cross-Platform Compatibility
**As a** platform developer  
**I want** the module path change to work identically across macOS, Linux, and Windows  
**So that** all developers share consistent experience regardless of environment

#### Acceptance Criteria:
3.1 The build system MUST produce identical binaries regardless of module path reference
3.2 Cross-compilation targets (darwin-amd64, darwin-arm64, linux-amd64, linux-arm64, windows-amd64) MUST succeed
3.3 File path separators MUST be handled correctly for cross-platform builds
3.4 Module cache invalidation MUST occur automatically across developer machines

### 4. Build System Continuity
**As a** CI/CD administrator  
**I want** the build system to continue functioning after the module path change  
**So that** development workflows remain unbroken

#### Acceptance Criteria:
4.1 All Makefile targets MUST continue to function without modification
4.2 The binary output naming (`cce`) MUST remain unchanged
4.3 Build flags and linker parameters MUST continue to work correctly
4.4 Docker containers and build environments MUST cache the new module path

### 5. Backward Compatibility
**As a** API consumer  
**I want** to maintain backward compatibility with configuration files  
**So that** user configurations are preserved

#### Acceptance Criteria:
5.1 The configuration file format and location (`~/.claude-code-env/config.json`) MUST remain unchanged
5.2 The binary executable name (`cce`) MUST not be affected by module path change
5.3 Command-line interfaces and flags MUST be preserved
5.4 User environments and models configurations MUST continue to function

### 6. CI/CD Pipeline Updates
**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** the CI/CD pipeline to reflect the new module path  
**So that** automated builds and deployments continue to work

#### Acceptance Criteria:
6.1 GitHub Actions workflows (if any) MUST be updated to reference the new module path
6.2 Container images and registry references MUST be updated
6.3 Documentation generation tools (godoc) MUST reflect the new module path
6.4 Release tagging strategy MUST incorporate the new canonical path

### 7. Risk Mitigation
**As a** operations manager  
**I want** clear rollback procedures in case of migration failure  
**So that** system stability is maintained

#### Acceptance Criteria:
7.1 A full rollback mechanism MUST be documented and tested
7.2 The migration strategy MUST include pre-commit validation steps
7.3 Module cache cleaning procedures MUST be specified for each platform
7.4 Branch-based deployment validation MUST be enforced before mainline integration

### 8. Quality Assurance
**As a** QA engineer  
**I want** comprehensive validation after module path migration  
**So that** we ensure no regressions are introduced

#### Acceptance Criteria:
8.1 All existing tests MUST pass with the updated module path
8.2 New test suites for module path specific scenarios MUST be created
8.3 Integration testing across platforms MUST be performed
8.4 Security scanning tools must continue to work with new module path
