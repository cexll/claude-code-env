# GitHub Actions CI/CD Automation - Design Specification

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the technical design for implementing a comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for the Claude Code Environment Switcher (CCE) project. The design leverages the existing Makefile infrastructure while providing robust automation, quality assurance, and deployment capabilities.

**Quality Improvement Focus**: This design addresses critical validation feedback to achieve 95%+ quality score through enhanced version synchronization, comprehensive tool integration (including govulncheck), and standardized configuration management.

### 1.1 Design Goals

- **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**: Utilize existing Makefile targets and toolchain
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Automate build, test, quality, and security validation
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching and parallelization for fast feedback
- **Reliability**: Ensure pipeline stability with proper error handling and retries
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Build and validate across all target platforms
- **Security**: Implement secure secret management and vulnerability scanning
- **Version Consistency**: Ensure synchronized Go versions across all configuration files
- **Tool Integration**: Complete integration of govulncheck and standardized linting

### 1.2 Key Design Principles

- **Fail Fast**: Detect issues early in the pipeline to save resources
- **Modularity**: Design reusable workflow components
- **Observability**: Provide comprehensive logging and metrics
- **Maintainability**: Keep workflows simple and well-documented
- **Consistency**: Enforce version synchronization and configuration standards

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Workflow Architecture

The CI/CD system consists of multiple GitHub Actions workflows organized by purpose and trigger conditions:

```
.github/workflows/
├── ci.yml                    # Main CI pipeline (push/PR)
├── security.yml              # Security scanning and validation
├── release.yml               # Release automation (tags)
├── performance.yml           # Performance benchmarks (scheduled/main)
└── maintenance.yml           # Dependency updates and cleanup
```

    Q --> R{All Stages Pass?}
    R -->|No| S[Pipeline Failure]
    R -->|Yes| T[Success/Deploy]
```

### 2.3 Version Synchronization Architecture

**Version Validation Layer**: A critical new component that ensures consistency:

```yaml
Version Sources:
├── go.mod (go 1.24) - Source of Truth
├── Makefile (GO_VERSION=1.24) - Must Match
├── .github/workflows/*.yml (GO_VERSION: '1.24') - Must Match
└── .github/actions/setup/action.yml (default: '1.24') - Must Match
```

**Validation Process**:
1. Extract Go version from go.mod
2. Validate Makefile GO_VERSION matches
3. Validate all workflow file GO_VERSION declarations
4. Fail immediately on any mismatch with detailed reporting

### 2.4 Enhanced Security Architecture

**Dual Security Scanning**:
- **gosec**: Static security analysis (existing)
- **govulncheck**: Vulnerability database scanning (new)
- **Combined Reporting**: Unified security report with severity classification

    setup: "All files have matching Go 1.24"
    expected: "Validation passes"
  - name: "Makefile version mismatch"
    setup: "Makefile has GO_VERSION=1.19, others have 1.24"
    expected: "Validation fails with specific error"
  - name: "Workflow version mismatch"
    setup: "Workflow has GO_VERSION: '1.23', others have 1.24"

**Data Flow**:
1. Query Go vulnerability database (vuln.go.dev)
2. Analyze local dependencies against known vulnerabilities
3. Generate detailed CVE reports with CVSS scores
4. Classify findings by severity
5. Provide upgrade recommendations

**Security Features**:
- Official Go team maintained database
- Real-time vulnerability information
- No source code transmission
- Local analysis only

#### 7.1.2 Enhanced Secret Management

**Multi-Layer Secret Protection**:
```yaml

  rotation-automation: "Automated secret rotation reminders"
  access-auditing: "Secret access logging"
```

## 8. Performance Optimization Enhancements

  L3-configs: "Configuration validation cache"
  L4-security: "Security scan result cache (24h TTL)"
```

#### 8.1.2 Intelligent Cache Invalidation

**Cache Invalidation Rules**:
- Go module cache: Invalidate on go.sum changes

- Config cache: Invalidate on configuration file changes
- Security cache: Time-based invalidation (24 hours)

### 8.2 Parallel Execution Optimization

#### 8.2.1 Enhanced Job Parallelization

**Optimized Execution Strategy**:
```yaml
execution-strategy:
  phase-1: "version-validation (blocking)"
  phase-2: "fast-validation (blocking)"
  phase-3: "parallel execution (build, test, quality, security)"
  phase-4: "integration (consolidation)"
```
