# Requirements Document: Command Pass-through Architecture and Model Configuration Support

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing two critical enhancements to the Claude Code Environment Switcher (CCE):

1. **Command Pass-through Architecture**: Enable CCE to intelligently delegate non-CCE-specific commands to the Claude CLI while maintaining environment injection capabilities
2. **Model Configuration Support**: Extend environment configurations to include optional model specifications that are injected at runtime

These features will transform CCE from a simple environment switcher to a comprehensive Claude CLI wrapper that preserves all Claude functionality while adding environment and model management capabilities.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Command Pass-through Architecture

#### 1.1 Intelligent Command Routing
**User Story**: As a Claude user, I want to use `cce` as a drop-in replacement for `claude` so that I can access all Claude CLI functionality while benefiting from environment management.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the user runs `cce` with Claude CLI flags that CCE doesn't handle, THEN CCE SHALL delegate the command to `claude` with environment variables injected
2. WHEN the user runs `cce` with CCE-specific flags (--env, --config), THEN CCE SHALL handle the command internally
3. WHEN the user runs `cce` with mixed CCE and Claude flags, THEN CCE SHALL process CCE flags and pass Claude flags to the underlying `claude` command
4. WHEN the user runs `cce` without arguments, THEN CCE SHALL maintain current interactive environment selection behavior
5. WHEN delegation occurs, CCE SHALL inject ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variables before launching `claude`

#### 1.2 Flag Conflict Resolution
**User Story**: As a developer, I want CCE to handle flag conflicts gracefully so that existing workflows continue to function without modification.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN CCE and Claude CLI share flag names, THEN CCE flags SHALL take precedence and be removed before delegating to Claude
2. WHEN flag conflicts occur, CCE SHALL log the conflict resolution in verbose mode
3. WHEN CCE processes a help command (`--help` or `-h`), THEN CCE SHALL display combined help including both CCE and Claude CLI options
4. WHEN invalid flags are provided, CCE SHALL provide clear error messages indicating whether the flag belongs to CCE or Claude CLI

#### 1.3 Argument Preservation
**User Story**: As a Claude CLI user, I want all my arguments and flags to be preserved when using CCE so that complex command invocations work identically.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN arguments contain special characters, quotes, or escape sequences, THEN they SHALL be preserved exactly as provided
2. WHEN arguments include file paths or glob patterns, THEN they SHALL be passed through without modification
3. WHEN the user provides stdin input, THEN it SHALL be passed through to the Claude CLI process
4. WHEN Claude CLI returns exit codes, THEN CCE SHALL preserve and return the same exit codes

#### 1.4 Signal Handling Enhancement
**User Story**: As a developer using CCE in scripts, I want signal handling to work correctly so that process management behaves identically to direct Claude CLI usage.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN CCE receives SIGINT (Ctrl+C), THEN it SHALL forward the signal to the Claude CLI process
2. WHEN CCE receives SIGTERM, THEN it SHALL gracefully shutdown and forward the signal
3. WHEN the Claude CLI process exits, THEN CCE SHALL exit with the same status code
4. WHEN CCE is killed, THEN any child Claude CLI processes SHALL be properly terminated

### 2. Model Configuration Support

#### 2.1 Environment Model Configuration
**User Story**: As a Claude user working with different API providers, I want to specify different models for different environments so that I can optimize model selection for specific use cases.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN configuring an environment, THEN users SHALL be able to optionally specify a model name
2. WHEN a model is specified for an environment, THEN CCE SHALL inject the ANTHROPIC_MODEL environment variable when launching Claude CLI
3. WHEN no model is specified for an environment, THEN no ANTHROPIC_MODEL variable SHALL be set (preserving Claude CLI defaults)
4. WHEN environment configurations are loaded, THEN model specifications SHALL be validated for basic format correctness
5. WHEN environments are listed, THEN model information SHALL be displayed alongside other environment details

#### 2.2 Configuration Management Updates
**User Story**: As a CCE user, I want to manage model configurations through the same interface as other environment settings so that the experience is consistent.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN adding a new environment, THEN users SHALL be prompted for an optional model specification
2. WHEN editing an environment, THEN users SHALL be able to modify the model specification
3. WHEN importing/exporting configurations, THEN model specifications SHALL be included
4. WHEN validating configurations, THEN model field formatting SHALL be checked
5. WHEN migrating from older configuration versions, THEN model fields SHALL be added with null/empty values

#### 2.3 Interactive UI Enhancements
**User Story**: As a CCE user, I want model information to be clearly displayed in selection menus so that I can make informed environment choices.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN displaying environment selection menus, THEN model information SHALL be shown in environment descriptions
2. WHEN model information is missing, THEN the description SHALL indicate "Default model"
3. WHEN entering model information, THEN input validation SHALL prevent obviously invalid model names
4. WHEN verbose mode is enabled, THEN model injection SHALL be logged during CLI launch
5. WHEN using non-interactive mode, THEN model configuration SHALL work without user prompts

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 3. Performance Requirements

#### 3.1 Command Routing Performance
**User Story**: As a developer using CCE in automated workflows, I want minimal overhead so that build times and script performance are not impacted.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN routing commands to Claude CLI, THEN the overhead SHALL be less than 50ms on modern hardware
2. WHEN processing command arguments, THEN parsing SHALL complete in under 10ms for typical command lines
3. WHEN injecting environment variables, THEN the setup time SHALL be negligible (< 5ms)
4. WHEN loading configuration files, THEN caching SHALL minimize repeated file I/O

#### 3.2 Memory Efficiency
**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN running as a pass-through wrapper, THEN CCE SHALL use less than 10MB additional memory overhead
2. WHEN processing large argument lists, THEN memory usage SHALL scale linearly
3. WHEN caching configuration data, THEN memory usage SHALL be bounded and configurable

### 4. Reliability Requirements

#### 4.1 Error Handling and Recovery
**User Story**: As a CCE user, I want clear error messages and graceful failure handling so that I can quickly resolve issues.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN Claude CLI is not found, THEN CCE SHALL provide actionable error messages with installation guidance
2. WHEN environment injection fails, THEN CCE SHALL fall back to direct Claude CLI launch with warnings
3. WHEN configuration files are corrupted, THEN CCE SHALL offer recovery options
4. WHEN network validation fails, THEN CCE SHALL allow bypass options for offline usage
