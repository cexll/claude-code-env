# CCE Argument Passthrough Fix - Requirements

## Introduction

Claude Code Environment Switcher (CCE) currently fails when users attempt to pass Claude CLI flags like `-r` that are not recognized by CCE's Cobra command parser. The command `cce -r "You are a helpful assistant"` fails with "unknown shorthand flag: 'r'" instead of delegating to Claude CLI as intended. This specification addresses the argument parsing flow to ensure seamless passthrough functionality while maintaining 95%+ code quality standards.

## User Stories and Requirements

### 1. Unknown Flag Passthrough

**User Story**: As a user, I want to use any Claude CLI flag with CCE so that I can leverage the full Claude CLI functionality while benefiting from CCE's environment management.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN I run `cce -r "instruction"`, THEN CCE SHALL delegate to Claude CLI with the `-r` flag
2. WHEN I run `cce --unknown-flag value`, THEN CCE SHALL pass the flag through to Claude CLI
3. WHEN I run `cce --env production -r "instruction"`, THEN CCE SHALL extract the `--env` flag and pass `-r` to Claude CLI
4. WHEN Claude CLI returns an error for invalid flags, THEN the error SHALL be displayed to the user without CCE interference

### 2. Mixed Flag Handling

**User Story**: As a user, I want to mix CCE-specific flags with Claude CLI flags in a single command so that I can specify environment settings alongside Claude instructions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN I run `cce --env staging --verbose -r "debug this"`, THEN CCE SHALL use the staging environment and pass `-r "debug this"` to Claude CLI
2. WHEN I run `cce -e prod --model claude-3-sonnet -r "help"`, THEN CCE SHALL apply prod environment and pass `--model` and `-r` flags to Claude CLI
3. WHEN conflicting flags exist, THEN CCE flags SHALL take precedence with clear precedence logging
4. WHEN verbose mode is enabled, THEN CCE SHALL log the flag separation and delegation process

### 3. Argument Structure Preservation

**User Story**: As a user, I want complex arguments with quotes, spaces, and special characters to be preserved exactly when passed to Claude CLI so that my instructions are not corrupted.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN I use quoted arguments like `cce -r "You are a helpful assistant with 'quotes'"`, THEN the quotes SHALL be preserved exactly
2. WHEN I use arguments with spaces like `cce --system "Long system message with spaces"`, THEN the spacing SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN I use escape sequences, THEN they SHALL be passed through without modification
4. WHEN I use shell-specific characters, THEN they SHALL be properly escaped for Claude CLI

### 4. Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story**: As a user, I want clear error messages when CCE cannot process my command so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN Claude CLI is not installed, THEN CCE SHALL display installation instructions
2. WHEN an environment is specified but doesn't exist, THEN CCE SHALL list available environments
3. WHEN argument parsing fails, THEN CCE SHALL suggest the correct syntax
4. WHEN delegation fails, THEN CCE SHALL preserve the original Claude CLI exit code and error message

### 5. Backward Compatibility

**User Story**: As an existing CCE user, I want all my current commands to continue working exactly as before so that this fix doesn't break my workflow.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN I run `cce` without arguments, THEN interactive environment selection SHALL work as before
2. WHEN I run `cce --env production`, THEN environment switching SHALL work as before
3. WHEN I run `cce env add`, THEN all CCE subcommands SHALL work as before
4. WHEN I run `cce --help`, THEN combined help output SHALL be displayed as before

### 6. Performance Requirements

**User Story**: As a user, I want CCE to add minimal overhead to my Claude CLI usage so that my workflow remains fast and responsive.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN parsing arguments, THEN the overhead SHALL be less than 10 milliseconds
2. WHEN delegating to Claude CLI, THEN the delegation SHALL add less than 5 milliseconds overhead
3. WHEN extracting CCE flags, THEN the process SHALL complete in under 2 milliseconds
4. WHEN environment injection occurs, THEN it SHALL not measurably impact Claude CLI startup time
