### Risk Mitigation
- **Feature Flags**: Enable/disable new functionality for safe rollback

### Success Validation
Upon completion of each phase, verify:
1. All quality gates are met
2. Performance requirements are satisfied
3. Security requirements are validated
4. Backward compatibility is maintained
5. Documentation is complete and accurate

The implementation targets achieving 95%+ code quality by systematically addressing all validation feedback while maintaining the core passthrough functionality.
