# CCE Enhancement Refinement Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the refinements needed for the Claude Code Environment Switcher (CCE) to address validation feedback and achieve a quality score of ≥95% (currently 94.1%). The enhancement focuses on addressing three critical gaps: terminal compatibility edge cases, model validation future-proofing, and enhanced error handling, while maintaining the KISS principles and security standards.

## Requirements

### 1. Terminal Compatibility Enhancement
**User Story**: As a user running CCE on various terminal environments, I want robust terminal compatibility detection and fallback mechanisms so that the application works reliably across all terminal types.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **Given** a terminal environment with limited capabilities, **when** CCE starts, **then** it shall detect terminal capabilities before attempting arrow key navigation
2. **Given** a terminal that doesn't support raw mode, **when** CCE needs input, **then** it shall gracefully fall back to numbered selection mode
3. **Given** a terminal with partial ANSI support, **when** CCE displays the interface, **then** it shall adapt the display to available features
4. **Given** terminal state corruption during execution, **when** CCE exits, **then** it shall restore the terminal to its original state
5. **Given** a headless or pipe environment, **when** CCE is executed, **then** it shall automatically use non-interactive mode

### 2. Model Validation Future-Proofing
**User Story**: As a system administrator managing CCE deployments, I want flexible model validation that adapts to new Anthropic model naming conventions so that the tool remains functional with future API updates.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **Given** a new Anthropic model naming pattern, **when** CCE validates API responses, **then** it shall accept models following documented Anthropic conventions
2. **Given** configuration options for model validation, **when** CCE is deployed in enterprise environments, **then** administrators shall be able to configure custom model patterns
3. **Given** API responses with unknown model names, **when** CCE processes the response, **then** it shall log the unknown model and continue operation
4. **Given** backwards compatibility requirements, **when** CCE validates existing model names, **then** it shall maintain support for all current Anthropic model patterns
5. **Given** validation failures for new models, **when** CCE encounters unknown patterns, **then** it shall provide clear guidance on updating validation rules

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling and Recovery
**User Story**: As a user experiencing system issues, I want comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms so that CCE provides clear feedback and graceful degradation in failure scenarios.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **Given** terminal state corruption, **when** CCE encounters an error, **then** it shall restore terminal state before exiting
2. **Given** network connectivity issues, **when** CCE attempts API validation, **then** it shall provide clear error messages with retry options
3. **Given** insufficient system permissions, **when** CCE accesses configuration files, **then** it shall provide specific guidance on required permissions
4. **Given** corrupted configuration data, **when** CCE loads configuration, **then** it shall recover gracefully and offer configuration repair options
5. **Given** Claude Code binary unavailability, **when** CCE attempts to launch, **then** it shall provide installation guidance and alternative options

### 4. Quality Score Achievement
**User Story**: As a project stakeholder, I want CCE to achieve ≥95% quality score through systematic improvements while maintaining existing functionality and principles.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **Given** validation metrics, **when** enhancements are implemented, **then** terminal compatibility shall score ≥96%
2. **Given** extensibility requirements, **when** model validation is enhanced, **then** future-proofing shall score ≥96%
3. **Given** error scenarios, **when** enhanced error handling is implemented, **then** robustness shall score ≥96%
4. **Given** KISS principles, **when** refinements are made, **then** simplicity score shall remain ≥98%
5. **Given** security requirements, **when** changes are implemented, **then** security score shall remain ≥96%

### 5. Implementation Constraints
**User Story**: As a developer maintaining CCE, I want refinements that respect existing architecture and constraints so that the codebase remains maintainable and consistent.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **Given** current codebase size (~300 lines), **when** enhancements are added, **then** total addition shall not exceed 100 lines
2. **Given** dependency requirements, **when** improvements are implemented, **then** no new external dependencies shall be introduced
3. **Given** existing functionality, **when** refinements are made, **then** all current features shall remain fully functional
4. **Given** test coverage (87%), **when** code is added, **then** test coverage shall be maintained or improved
5. **Given** backward compatibility, **when** configuration handling is enhanced, **then** existing config files shall continue to work without modification

### 6. Performance and Compatibility
**User Story**: As a user on various platforms, I want CCE refinements to maintain excellent performance and cross-platform compatibility so that the tool works consistently across environments.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **Given** startup performance requirements, **when** terminal detection is added, **then** startup time shall not increase by more than 100ms
2. **Given** memory constraints, **when** enhanced error handling is implemented, **then** memory usage shall not increase by more than 5%
3. **Given** cross-platform requirements, **when** terminal compatibility is enhanced, **then** functionality shall work on macOS, Linux, and Windows
4. **Given** existing interfaces, **when** model validation is enhanced, **then** API compatibility shall be maintained
5. **Given** user experience, **when** fallback mechanisms are implemented, **then** degraded modes shall provide clear user feedback

## Success Criteria

The enhancement shall be considered successful when:

1. **Quality Score**: Overall validation score ≥95%
2. **Terminal Compatibility**: Robust operation across all common terminal environments
3. **Future-Proofing**: Model validation adapts to new Anthropic conventions
4. **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful recovery
5. **Principle Adherence**: KISS principles maintained (≥98% score)
6. **Security Standards**: Security standards maintained (≥96% score)
7. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved
8. **Performance**: No significant performance degradation
