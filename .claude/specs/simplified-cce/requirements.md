# Requirements for Simplified Claude Code Environment Switcher

## Introduction

The Simplified Claude Code Environment Switcher (CCE) is a minimal Go CLI tool that manages multiple Claude Code API endpoint configurations and launches Claude Code with appropriate environment variables. This tool follows KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles and eliminates over-engineering while focusing solely on the core functionality: switching between API configurations and launching Claude Code.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**: This implementation must address security vulnerabilities and reliability issues to achieve production readiness (95% quality threshold).

## Feature Requirements

### 1. Environment Configuration Management
**User Story**: As a developer, I want to store and manage multiple Claude Code API configurations, so that I can easily switch between different endpoints without manually setting environment variables.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1.1. The system SHALL store API configurations in a simple JSON file at `~/.claude-code-env/config.json`
1.2. Each configuration SHALL contain a name, base URL, and API key
1.3. The system SHALL support basic CRUD operations for configurations (add, list, remove)
1.4. The system SHALL validate that base URLs are well-formed HTTP/HTTPS URLs
1.5. The system SHALL create the configuration directory with appropriate permissions if it doesn't exist
1.6. The system SHALL handle missing or corrupted configuration files gracefully
1.7. The system SHALL check and handle all error returns from critical file operations (open, read, write, close)
1.8. The system SHALL provide actionable error messages when configuration operations fail

### 2. Environment Selection and Switching
**User Story**: As a developer, I want to select an API configuration interactively or via command line flags, so that I can quickly switch between different Claude Code environments.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
2.1. The system SHALL provide an interactive menu to select from available configurations when no specific environment is specified
2.2. The system SHALL allow direct environment selection via a `--env` or `-e` flag
2.3. The system SHALL display clear error messages when a requested environment doesn't exist
2.4. The system SHALL show the currently selected environment before launching Claude Code
2.5. The system SHALL validate that the selected environment has all required fields (name, URL, API key)
2.6. The system SHALL handle all error returns from environment selection operations
2.7. The system SHALL provide recovery suggestions when environment selection fails

### 3. Claude Code Launching
**User Story**: As a developer, I want the tool to launch Claude Code with the correct environment variables, so that Claude Code connects to my selected API endpoint automatically.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
3.1. The system SHALL set the ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL environment variable to the selected configuration's base URL
3.2. The system SHALL set the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable to the selected configuration's API key
3.3. The system SHALL execute the `claude-code` command with all original arguments passed through
3.4. The system SHALL inherit the current environment and only override the Anthropic-specific variables
3.5. The system SHALL provide clear error messages if Claude Code is not found in PATH
3.6. The system SHALL exit with the same exit code as the Claude Code process
3.7. The system SHALL handle all error returns from process execution operations
3.8. The system SHALL validate environment variable setting before launching Claude Code

### 4. Command Line Interface
**User Story**: As a developer, I want a simple command line interface, so that I can perform common operations efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
4.1. The system SHALL provide a `list` subcommand to show all configured environments
4.2. The system SHALL provide an `add` subcommand to add new environment configurations
4.3. The system SHALL provide a `remove` subcommand to delete environment configurations
4.4. The system SHALL provide a `run` subcommand (or default behavior) to launch Claude Code with selected environment
4.5. The system SHALL display help information with `--help` or `-h` flags
4.6. The system SHALL follow standard CLI conventions and return appropriate exit codes
4.7. The system SHALL handle all error returns from command line parsing operations
4.8. The system SHALL validate all command line arguments and provide helpful error messages

### 5. Security and Data Protection
**User Story**: As a developer, I want my API keys and configurations to be stored securely, so that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
5.1. The system SHALL create configuration directories with 700 permissions (owner read/write/execute only)
5.2. The system SHALL create configuration files with 600 permissions (owner read/write only)
5.3. The system SHALL use hidden/masked input for API keys during interactive entry (characters must NOT be visible in terminal)
5.4. The system SHALL not display API keys in plain text in any output or error messages
5.5. The system SHALL validate input to prevent basic injection attacks or malformed data
5.6. The system SHALL implement secure terminal input using system-specific methods (termios on Unix, console API on Windows)
5.7. The system SHALL handle errors from secure input operations gracefully
5.8. The system SHALL clear sensitive data from memory where possible

### 6. Error Handling and User Experience
**User Story**: As a developer, I want clear error messages and graceful failure handling, so that I can quickly understand and resolve issues.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
6.1. The system SHALL provide descriptive error messages for common failure scenarios
6.2. The system SHALL handle file system errors gracefully (permissions, disk space, etc.)
6.3. The system SHALL validate user input and provide helpful feedback for invalid data
6.4. The system SHALL continue operating when non-critical errors occur
6.5. The system SHALL use consistent error formatting and exit codes
6.6. The system SHALL provide suggestions for resolving common errors when possible
6.7. The system SHALL check and handle ALL error returns from function calls
6.8. The system SHALL never ignore error returns from critical operations
6.9. The system SHALL implement proper error wrapping to maintain context
6.10. The system SHALL log errors appropriately without exposing sensitive information

### 7. Testing and Quality Assurance
**User Story**: As a developer, I want the tool to be thoroughly tested and reliable, so that I can depend on it for daily development work.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
7.1. The system SHALL include unit tests for all core functions with minimum 80% coverage
7.2. The system SHALL include tests for error handling scenarios
7.3. The system SHALL include tests for secure input functionality
7.4. The system SHALL include integration tests for complete workflows
7.5. The system SHALL include tests for file permission validation
7.6. The system SHALL include tests for configuration validation
7.7. The system SHALL verify that all error returns are properly handled in tests
7.8. The system SHALL test both success and failure paths for all operations
7.9. The system SHALL use temporary directories and cleanup in tests
7.10. The system SHALL mock external dependencies (file system, processes) appropriately

### 8. Input Validation and Sanitization
**User Story**: As a developer, I want the tool to validate all inputs properly, so that invalid data doesn't cause crashes or security issues.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
8.1. The system SHALL validate all URL inputs using proper URL parsing
8.2. The system SHALL validate environment names for allowed characters and length
8.3. The system SHALL validate API key format and basic structure
8.4. The system SHALL sanitize all user inputs before processing
8.5. The system SHALL reject invalid inputs with clear error messages

8.7. The system SHALL validate file paths and permissions before operations
8.8. The system SHALL check for required fields in all data structures
